<!-- <h4>Hi, I'm Aeriel!</h4>
          <p id="bio">25 year old college graduate from The University of Texas at Austin.  Received my degree in Kinesiology, but soon decided that was not the career path for me!  Two years after graduation, I found myself at crossroads, and decided to pursue a career in Web Development.  My goal is to continue to learn new technologies and be a resourceful teammember in any company!

          <h2>Before Coding...</h2>
            <p>Before coding, I was a professional tennis coach.  I love teaching kids and creating a curriculum of sorts that would allow students to improve as for as their skill would take them</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>As a new mom, my daughter became the reason why I woke up every day, to show her that as a woman, ANYTHING was possible, and that she too could do anything that she set her mind to</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>However, I was in limbo.  I knew full and well that tennis was not my true destiny.  I needed to figure out what I was passionate about and take a leap of faith with it</p>

          <h2>Welcome to the Dojo</h2>
            <p>Ironically, it was one of my previous tennis instructors who introduced me to the idea of coding.  Mind you, I had very little knowledge about the internet, other than how to search google.  Fortunately, I spent some time on CodeAcademy (Javascript), and decided to take that leap of faith, and sign up for Coding Dojo</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>For 14 weeks, I spent anywhere from 10-12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week coding.  It was rough! There were days that I wanted to quit, days that I wasn't so sure that I made the right decision to learn how to code.  Something in the back of my head told me otherwise, and that I should just keep pluggin along</p>
            <div classs="divider"></div>
            <p>On May 27th, 2016, it all paid off.  I graduated with two solid projects under my belt, and with the burning desire to learn more and do more</p> -->

            <p> Tennis Draws is a Web applicatiion that creates bracket-style tournaments for the user to use for tennis tournaments.  A user can register, create a tournament and then create multiple draws for that specific tournament.  Once a tournament is created, users can be added to and removed from the draws and tournaments.  Lastly, a user can see the actual tournament draw that they created, and are able to input the winners for each round, along with displaying the score of the previous match-up
